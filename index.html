  <p>This is my first website.</p>

  <h2>About</h2>
  <p>
    The intention behind this website is 2-folds. 1, I want to have a personal website that shows my experiences and my portfolio that I am beginning to build. 2, I want to try vibe coding. The 1st point is straightforward but the 2nd point is more about walking to talk and being able to build things that I want. Thank you for visiting my site and please drop your feedback in my github.
